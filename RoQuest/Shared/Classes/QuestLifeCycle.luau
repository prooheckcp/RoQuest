	QuestLifeCycles are classes that are used to give behavior to our quests. They get associated to a quest when it gets declared
	and will allow the developer to update world instances and other things when the quest is available, started, completed or delivered

	:::info

	The lifecycle runs on the side where you injected it meaning that if you load a lifecycle in the server-side it will be
	managed by the server while if you inject it in the client it will be managed by the client

	:::

	```lua
	local appleQuest = QuestLifeCycle.new {
		Name = "AppleQuest",
	}

	function appleQuest:OnInit()
		print("AppleQuest OnInit")
	end

	function appleQuest:OnStart()
		print("AppleQuest has been started!")
	end

	function appleQuest:OnComplete()
		print("AppleQuest has been completed!")
	end

	function appleQuest:OnDeliver()
		print("AppleQuest has been delivered!")
	end

	function appleQuest:OnObjectiveChange(objectiveId: string, newAmount: number)
		print("Objective " .. objectiveId .. " has been updated to " .. newAmount)
	end

	function appleQuest:OnDestroy()
		print("AppleQuest has been destroyed!")
	end
