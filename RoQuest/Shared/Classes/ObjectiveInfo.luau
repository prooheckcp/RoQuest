    The ObjectiveInfo contains the static data for our quest objectives. This is where the developer
    should initiate the data for the objective as long as create the QuestObjective objects.

    ```lua

        ObjectiveId = "CollectApples",
        Name = "Collect Apples",
        Description = "Collect %s apples",
